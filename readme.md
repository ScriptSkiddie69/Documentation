# Lua documentation made by dex
# What is lua? 
lua is known for a coding language for roblox, world of warcraft otherwise it is used for networking
# Alright lets get started!

# Lets get started with datatypes.
Datatypes are group of collections of data values
These are:
```lua
table: {}
number or number: <number> or 1 for example
float: <float> or 0.1 or 1.1
boolean or bool: true, false
string or str: "Hello This is a string" 
nil: nil represents no value so its like 0 but it has nothing in it
```
We only listed simple datatypes as to not get confusing we'll get to the advanced later
# Lua keywords:
```lua
and,	break,	do,	else
elseif,	end,	false,	for,
function,	if,	in,	local,
nil,	not,	or,	repeat,
return,	then,	true,	until,
while

```
# Basic lua syntax
Now lets get to the real coding part!
How are we gonna output strings, variable, etc into the console?
Heres how:
```lua
print('Hello World')
```
# Output:
```lua
Hello World
```
Notice how it outputted Hello World? we could do a different one
```lua
print('Hello from dex!')
```
# Output:
```lua
Hello from dex!
```
Now it says hello from dex!
How would we use variable in this case? heres how
```lua
local anyname = <datatype>
```
We need to use any data type to be stored in the variable
Lets use string!
```lua
local anyname = "Hello World"
print(anyname)
```
# Output:
```lua
Hello World
```
